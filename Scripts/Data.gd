var text = """U.S. equities futures dipped slightly Wednesday after stocks extended their rally in the previous session, even as fears of an inverted yield curve sparked recession concerns and investors continued watching developments play out in Ukraine.
Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 76 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.4%.
Russia said late Tuesday it would reduce its military presence in some parts of Ukraine, but several countries — including the U.S. and U.K. — remain skeptical over Moscow’s pledge. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued Wednesday."""
